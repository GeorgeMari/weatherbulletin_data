The populated places files are obtained from:
http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm

Partway down this page is a list of "Topical Gazetteers", with a link explaining
the file format, a bulleted list of the different data files available, 
and a drop-down list from which you can select which file to download.
The Populated Places file contains a list of all US populated places
(Cities, towns, etc.)

The data sets here seem to be updated quarterly.
